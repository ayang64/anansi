	* nsd/conn.c: Added [ns_conn channel] (RFE #1156141)
	  Also, added [ns_conncptofp ?-bytes toCopy? channel]
	  (RFE #1156899). This change scraps parsing of the 
	  dummy connId argument left for 2.x server compat.

	* nsd/nsd.h
	* nsd/unix.h
	* nsd/nsmain.h: Added watchdog implementation (RFE #1156875)

        * nspd/
        * nsext/: moved modules out of the core into modules /section

2005-03-08  Vlad Seryakov <vlad@crystalballinc.com>

	* nslog/nslog.c: as Stephan pointed there is possibility for 
	server to crash under some conditions accessing already freed 
	extheaders pointer. So i put lock before putting extheaders values 
        in the log, in most cases extheaders are empty so there is no overhead.

2005-03-07  Zoran Vasiljevic  <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* nslog/nslog.c: fixed bad handling of rollfmt arg which
	caused segmetantion if the alternative rollfmt was not
	defined.

        status if third argument is provided. ns_conn status ?newStatus?

        * nslog/nslog.c: changed syntax to conform naviserver style,
        no functional modifications

	* nsd/tclobjv.c: Add support for boolean options which take no
	argument. Truth is determined by presence of the option alone.

	* nslog/nslog.c: redone options support for the module
        using flags, added commands to ns_accesslog to change flags and/or
        extended headers on the fly 

2005-02-27  Stephen Deasey  <sdeasey@users.sf.net>

	* include/ns.h: Added declarations... 
 	 for following structs:
	    o. Ns_ObjvSpec
	    o. Ns_ObjvTable
	  and following calls:
	    o. Ns_ParseObjv
	    o. Ns_ObjvBool
	    o. Ns_ObjvInt
	    o. Ns_ObjvLong
	    o. Ns_ObjvWideInt

	* nsd/unix.c:
	* include/ns.h: added Ns_GetNameForUid(), Ns_GetNameForGid()
	
	* nsd/nsmain.c: allows server to be started as uid == 0
	  if both of the following are true:
	     o. the caller process is running as root (getuid() == 0)
	     o. "-u root" or "-u 0" was given on the command line
	  Also, improved and tightented verification of passed user
	  and/or group information.
