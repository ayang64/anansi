<h2><a name=1>NaviServer Configuration</a></h2>

<p>

NaviServer has many configurable parameters, all of which are set in
the NaviServer configuration file. This chapter provides a reference of
the configuration file structure and parameters so that you can edit
the configuration file directly.

<p>

By modifying and/or adding NaviServer configuration parameters, you
can:

<ul>

<li> Define multiple servers, one of which will run within each running NaviServer process.

<p>

<li> Define multiple database pools with different data sources that
 can be accessed by any or all of the servers.

<p>

<li> Configure various NaviServer capabilities or optionally-loaded
     modules for each of the servers.

</ul>

<p>

 <h3>What is a database pool?</h3>

<p>

A database pool is a set of connections to a database. NaviServer
currently supports direct connections to the Sybase/MS SQL Server and
Postgres databases. Third-party database drivers are available for
Mysql, Oracle, Informix, and InterBase. As far as configuration is
concerned, you simply specify a database (or data source) that you
want NaviServer to access. NaviServer then manages a set of connections
to the database that it uses internally to efficiently process database
operations. You can also access these connections directly through the
Tcl and C interfaces.

<p>

 <h3>What are the default NaviServer capabilities?</h3>

<p>

The following capabilites are provided by default for every server and
can be configured by manually editing the configuration file.

<p>

<ul>

<li> ADPs: This capability allows you to embed Tcl scripts within an
     HTML page. The pages are parsed and run on the server when the
     page is accessed.

<p>

<li> db: This capability allows you to use NaviServer's database
     services. nsdb module needs to be loaded for database access.

<p>

<li> tcl: This capability allows you to use NaviServer's Tcl API. See
     the Tcl Developer's Guide for information on Tcl.

</ul>

<p>

 <h3>What is an NaviServer module?</h3>

<p>

NaviServer modules are shared libraries or dynamically-linked libraries
that provide specific sets of capabilities that you can load in your
servers. The following standard modules are provided:

<p>

<ul>

<li> nscgi: This capability allows you to run CGI programs from NaviServer.

<p>

<li> nscp: This module enables the control port interface that allows
     you to administer a running server.

<p>

<li> nslog: This module enables access logging in the CERN Common Log
     Format. The nslog module can also log the Refer and User-Agent
     client headers.

<p>

<li> nsperm: This module enables access control capabilities --
     defining users, groups, and permissions.

<p>

<li> nssock: This module enables communications using ordinary TCP/IP
     Internet sockets.

<p>

<li> nsproxy: This module provides a  simple,  robust  proxy  mechanism  to
     evaluate  Tcl scripts in a separate, pipe-connected process.

</ul>

<p>

<h2><a name=2>Configuration File Structure</a></h2>

<p>

This section describes the format of the configuration file and
provides detailed information on individual NaviServer parameters.

<p>

The configuration file is normally the nsd.tcl file in the NaviServer
home directory (the directory where NaviServer was installed). You must
specify the configuration file when you start up NaviServer with the -c
command line flag.

<p>

The configuration file is a Tcl file that can be modified with a text
editor such as vi or emacs on Unix. The file is made up of named
sections with one or more parameters. Each section heading is of the
form "ns/...". Each parameter is composed of a parameter name and a
parameter value. The parameters of a section continue until a new
section is defined or until the end of the file.

<p>

The ns_section and ns_param Tcl functions are used to define each
section and the parameters for each section in the configuration file.
The general format of the configuration file is as follows:

<p>

<pre>
 ns_section "ns/..."
 ns_param param-name param-value
 ...
</pre>

<p>

<h2><a name=3>Configuration File Hierarchy</a></h2>

<p>

Although there are a large number of configurable parameters for
NaviServer, most of them are not required. Also, the parameters are
organized into a hierarchy branching off of the following main
sections, letting you configure NaviServer at a global level, configure
each server, and configure each database you will be accessing. This
hierarchy of sections allows you maximum flexibility to provide
exactly the capabilities you need on each server, including where
pages will be stored and which databases will be accessible.

<p>

<ul>

<li> Parameters: This part of the configuration file contains parameters that
     apply to the NaviServer process:

 <ul>

 <li> ns/parameters specifies parameters such as the NaviServer home directory.

 <li> MIME Types: This part of the configuration file lists global MIME types.

 <li> ns/mimetypes maps file name extensions to content-type headers.

 </ul>

<li> Servers: This part of the configuration file configures one or
     more servers, one of which that can be run within each NaviServer
     process. It is the top level in a hierarchy of sections for each server.

 <ul>

 <li> ns/servers lists and names all of the servers.

 <li> ns/server/servername configures an individual server.

 <li> ns/server/servername/adp configures NaviServer Dynamic Pages (ADPs) for the server.

 <li> ns/server/servername/adp/parsers configures ADP parsers.

 <li> ns/server/servername/db configures database connections used by the server.

 <li> ns/server/servername/fastpath configures fastpath serving of static files.

 <li> ns/server/servername/realms configures logging realms for individual modules.

 <li> ns/server/servername/redirects configures redirects.

 <li> ns/server/servername/tcl configures Tcl for the server.

 <li> ns/server/servername/modules lists the modules available to each server.

 </ul>

<li> ns/server/servername/module/nscgi configures CGI
     (Common Gateway Interface) for the server. See also the
     CGI interpreters and CGI environment configuration
     sections on page 48 for additional CGI configuration.

<li> ns/server/servername/module/nscp configures the control
     port administration interface.

<li> ns/server/servername/module/nscp/users configures the
     users allowed to access the control port administration
     interface.

<li> ns/server/servername/module/nslog configures the access
     log module loaded into a server.

<li> ns/server/servername/module/nsperm configures the
     permissions module loaded into a server.

<li> ns/server/servername/module/nssock configures the
     sockets module loaded into a server.

<li> Database Drivers and Pools: This part of the configuration file
     configures the database drivers (the type of database you will be
     using) and the database pools (connections to the database).

 <ul>

 <li> ns/db/drivers lists the database drivers available to
      NaviServer. Currently internal database drivers are available
      for Sybase/MS SQL Server and Postgres.

 <li> ns/db/driver/extname configures an external database   driver.

 <li> ns/db/pools lists the database pools available to NaviServer.

 <li> ns/db/pool/pool-name configures a database pool, which
      determines the database to access and how many
      connections there will be to it.

 </ul>

<li> CGI Interpreters: This section allows you to configure the
     interpreters to execute for CGI scripts that end with certain file
     extensions. For example, you can configure the perl.exe
     interpreter to be invoked for all CGI's that end in .pl.

 <ul>

 <li> ns/interps/interps-name defines an interps section for CGI modules.

 <li> CGI Environment: This section allows you to configure environment
      variables in addition to the standard CGI environment variables
      for all CGI's or specific CGI interpreters.

 <li> ns/environment/environment-name defines an environment section for CGI modules.

 </ul>

</ul>

<p>

 <h3>Note on Boolean Parameter Values</h3>

<p>

There are several ways to specify a boolean parameter value. The
reference tables below use "on" for true and "off" for false. However,
any of the following values are valid:

<p>

For <b>True</b> : on, y, yes, t, true, 1 (one)

<p>

For <b>False</b> : off, n, no, f, false, 0 (zero)

<p>


<h2><a name=5>Example Configuration Files</a></h2>

<p>

 Default Configuration File

<p>

The default sample-config.tcl comes with NaviServer. There is one server defined,
server1, which contains the nscp, nslog, and nssock modules. You can
define multiple servers, but only one of them can be run with each
command line execution.  All this information is defined at the top of the file.

<p>
<a href=sample-config.tcl.txt>sample-config.tcl</a>

<p>

 Configuration for Multiple Database Pools

<p>

This configuration file defines one server named default and two
database pools named defdb and otherdb. A few things to note about
this configuration file are:

<p>

SOLID and Postgres database pools: The defdb database pool is
associated with an MS SQLServer database, and the otherdb database pool is
associated with a PostgreSQL database. (See the driver parameters in the
ns/db/pool/pool-name sections.)

<p>

MS SQLServer and Postgres drivers: The drivers used for all of the defined
database pools are listed in the ns/db/drivers section.

<p>

Database pools accessible by each server: The pools parameter in the
ns/server/default/db section specifies which database pool the default
server has access to. In this example, the default server can access
both the otherdb and the defdb database pools.
