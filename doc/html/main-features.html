<h1>NaviServer Features</h1>

<h2>What is NaviServer?</h2>

NaviServer is a World Wide Web server that provides access control and
database connections and runs on multiple UNIX platforms. NaviServer
can access SQL databases including Sybase, SOLID, Postgres, and some
third-party database drivers.

<p>

NaviServer is extendable with both C and Tcl APIs that expose core
functions and provide primitives for accessing the database. NaviServer
also provides optional CGI support, although the C and Tcl APIs are
more powerful, offer superior performance, and are easier to use.

<p>

You can configure multiple servers within one NaviServer configuration
file, and then specify which server to run when you run NaviServer.
NaviServer also uses a multi-threaded design on all supported
platforms. You can configure the number of threads each server can
use.

<p>

NaviServer offers direct connections to SQL databases such as Postgres, Sybase, MS SQLServer.
Third-party database drivers are provided for Oracle, Informix, and Interbase. You
can even configure NaviServer to have connections to multiple databases
and specify which databases are available to each server.

<p>

NaviServer also includes server administration capabilities. An access
control system allows you to specify separate permissions for each
combination of URL and HTTP method (GET, PUT, or POST). You can also
specify users and groups who are allowed access to NaviServer.

<p>

<h2>Features</h2>

 NaviServer Administration Features

<p>

 Access Control:

<p>

NaviServer's access control system allows you to define users, assign
users to groups, and set permissions for users, groups, and hosts.

<p>

When defining permissions for the NaviServer, you can specify lists of
users to allow or disallow, lists of groups to allow or disallow, and
hosts (specified either by host name or IP address) to allow or
disallow for each method/URL combination..

<p>

Multi-homing:

<p>

NaviServer allows you to run multiple servers on one host by attaching
them to different port and/or IP address combinations.

<p>

See the "Configuration for Multiple IP Addresses" section for
information on configuring NaviServer for multi-homing.

<p>

 Database Services Features

<p>

NaviServer manages pools of open connections to databases. These pools
let NaviServer quickly service simultaneous database requests (without
continuously opening and closing the database), and to prevent a large
number of HTTP requests from overloading the system. Both the Tcl and
C APIs provide access to these database pools.

<p>

 Programming Interface Features

<p>

 Tcl Interface:

<p>

NaviServer can be extended using the Tcl scripting language. NaviServer
provides a powerful Tcl API containing a full array of functions and
primitives that give you access to all of NaviServer's core
functionality and SQL databases. Tcl functions are available to
interact with the connection, implement scheduled procedures, maintain
state, access the sockets and threads interfaces, roll access logs,
maintain permissions, access the database, and much more.

<p>

You can create scripts in a private Tcl library for each server, or in
a library shared by multiple servers. Since Tcl is embedded in
NaviServer, a separate process is not required to run a Tcl script,
making Tcl extensions much more efficient than CGI-based extensions.

<p>

 NaviServer Dynamic Pages (ADPs)

<p>

ADPs allow you to embed Tcl scripts directly into HTML pages. The
script(s) are interpreted dynamically when the page is accessed.

<p>

 C Interface:

<p>

NaviServer can also be extended with the C API. The C API lets you
write your own logging routines, access control system, communications
drivers, or database drivers. It provides all the necessary functions
and structures you need to access NaviServer's core functionality and
the database.

<p>

To use the C API, you compile your C module into a Unix shared
library. NaviServer will dynamically load the module and call your
initialization function.

<p>

 CGI Support, Including CGI File Type Activation:

<p>

NaviServer provides full CGI support. Because running a CGI program
requires a separate process to be created, it is less efficient than
extending NaviServer with Tcl or C.

<p>

You can configure NaviServer to look for CGI programs in a specific
directory, or you can store CGI programs near the HTML files and refer
to them using the .cgi file type. Any file with the .cgi extension
will be interpreted as a CGI program by NaviServer. You can configure
NaviServer to activate the .cgi file type in specific directories or
groups of directories.

<p>

<h3>High Performance</h3>

Fast and efficient handling of simultaneous connections through a combination
of multi-threading, in-memory caching, and single-threaded asynchronous I/O.

NaviServer has an advanced multithreaded architecture.  Multithreading
features include:

<UL>
 <LI>Fast response without having to fork for each connection.
<P>

 <LI>Multiple, simultaneous servicing of connections.
<P>

 <LI>Ability to keep state in the address space of the single
 NaviServer process - no need to maintain slow and messy external
 files!

  <P>

 <LI>
Simple programming model where each request is handled in its own
thread, freeing the programmer from the worry of a long running
request blocking the server.
<P>

 <LI>
Fully configurable minimum and maximum number of threads on a
per-virtual server basis. Threads are transparently added when
demand rises and then slowly exit as demand falls.
<P>

 <LI>
The Tcl interface is fully multi-threaded aware - no special steps
are required to ensure proper concurrent script evaluation.
<P>

 <LI>
The <B><I><A NAME=nsthread>nsthread</A> </I></B>
platform-independent C API for multithreaded programming which
includes:

<UL>
<LI>
Functions to create and wait for new threads
<LI>
Mutex, critical section, semaphore, and event objects to protect shared resources
<LI>
Thread local storage for maintaining per-thread data
</UL>
<P>

 <LI>
The nsthread interface allows the NaviServer programmer to write
new C functions which use advanced multithreaded locking and
synchronization techniques independent of the host platform. In
fact, the NaviServer is written entirely using the nsthread
interface - no platform specific multithreading code is used
anywhere in the NaviServer or in any NaviServer module. No other Web
server provides this level of multithreaded programming support!
<P>

 <LI>
NaviServer performs in-memory caching of pages and scripts, and
single-threaded asynchronous I/O for returning static content.
<P>

</UL>

<h3>Tcl Scripting</h3>

Quickly add dynamic content to your website:

<ul>
<li>
Integrated multi-threaded interpreter runs scripts in parallel in one process
with complete access to server state

<li>
NaviServer Dynamic Pages (ADP's) allow embedding of Tcl scripts in HTML pages

<li>
Rich, easy-to-use scripting language loaded with new NaviServer-specific
extensions for building web applications

<li>
Ability to add your own C commands to the language
</ul>


NaviServer includes the Tcl (Tool Command Language) scripting language
as an integral part of its architecture:

<UL>

 <LI>
The Tcl interface allows you to quickly build custom Web
applications without C code or messy CGIs.
<P>

 <LI>
The Tcl interface is multithreaded, allowing more than one Tcl
script to operate in one or more virtual servers simultaneously.
<P>

 <LI>
Built-in Tcl scripts operate up to 10 times faster than comparable
Perl-based CGIs.
<P>

 <LI>
The Tcl interface can be extended to include your own custom Tcl
commands written as Tcl procedures or as C primitives.
<P>

 <LI>
NaviServer extends Tcl to include commands for accessing one more
open databases without writing any C code or executing slow
external CGIs.
<P>

 <LI>
The Tcl interface includes useful commands for accessing HTML form
data and information about the active connection.
<P>

 <LI>
The Tcl interface provides a command for opening a TCP/IP socket
which can be used to implement a quick HTTP transaction to another
Web server or send Email using SMTP (a procedure for sending email
is included).
<P>

 <LI>
Resources allocated during evaluation of a Tcl script (e.g., open
database handles, open files, Ns_Set data) are automatically
garbage collected after the script returns, freeing the script
developer of these tedious tasks.
<P>

 <LI>
Tcl scripts can be in the pages directory along with the HTML
pages and images or in a special Tcl library directory:

<UL>
<LI>
Scripts in the pages directory are evaluated on each
transaction which is ideal for quick script development.
<LI>
Scripts in the library directories are evaluated at startup
time for fast response without having to open and read the
script file.
</UL>
<P>

 <LI>
NaviServer includes an HTML-forms based interface for creating and
updating Tcl scripts which are located in the Tcl library
directory. Also included is a simple HTML form for ad-hoc
evaluation of a Tcl script typed directly into a text area box.
<P>

 <LI>
Tcl, unlike Java, has been in use by a large user community for
years (join the comp.lang.tcl newsgroup) and is well documented by
the creator of Tcl, John Ousterhout of Sun Microsystems.
<P>

 <LI>
NaviServer Dynamic Pages (ADP's) are HTML pages that are parsed and
run on the server when the page is accessed -- ADPs contain HTML
tags and Tcl scripts.  ADPs are ideal in situations where you want
to generate part or all of a specific page dynamically.
<P>

</UL>

<P>

<h3>Complete C API</h3>

<dd>
Write custom dynamically loaded modules for:

<ul>
<li>
Handling requests
<li>
Translating URLs
<li>
Logging
<li>
Database access
<li>
Thread creation and synchronization
<li>
And much more!
</ul>


The NaviServer includes a complete C API. Using the C API you can write:

<UL>

 <LI>
Custom request functions to handle HTTP request to an URL or a
complete hierarchy of URLs.
<P>

 <LI>
Custom URL-to-file translation routines to convert an HTTP URL to
a file in the local filesystem. This can be used to map URLs to
one or more filesystem directories as required for maintenance or
load balancing.
<P>

 <LI>
New Tcl commands for use in your Tcl scripts. NaviServer provides
initialization functions to ensure your command is available in
all the Tcl interpreters in a virtual server Tcl interpreter pool.
<P>

 <LI>
Database drivers to interface NaviServer to your own DBMS.
<P>

 <LI>
Communications drivers so NaviServer can implement HTTP over a new
underlying protocol:

<UL>

<LI>
The included <I><B>nssock</B></I> module implements HTTP over
regular TCP/IP sockets just like other basic Web servers such
as NCSA, CERN, or WebSite.
<P>

<LI>
Filter functions which run at any stage of each HTTP request. A
filter can be used to implement logging - in fact, this is how the
<I><B>nslog</B></I> Common Log Format logging module works.
<P>

<LI>
A scheduled procedure which runs at regular intervals. A scheduled
procedure can be used in conjunction with a filter function to
implement a statistics gathering system.
<P>

</UL>

<P>

No other Web server C API is as complete and powerful as the NaviServer
C API!

<p>

<h3>SQL Database Services</h3>

Powerful and easy access to a variety of SQL databases. Driver source
for PostgreSQL and Sybase/MSSQLServer are included with others available from third
parties.

<P>
NaviServer includes loads of features to help you connect your website
to SQL databases:

<UL>
 <LI>
Provides a platform independent interface to SQL relational databases.
<P>

 <LI>
Connects to underlying database servers through plug-in database
drivers:

 Informix, Oracle, Interbase, and MySQL.
<P>
</UL>

 <LI>
NaviServer maintains one or more <I><B>pools</B></I> with one or
more open database connections. By maintaining open connections,
HTTP requests have instant access to the database instead of
incurring the expensive startup time of a CGI-based solution.
<P>

 <LI>
Requests are queued in first in, first out order to ensure
efficient and fair use of database resources.
<P>

 <LI>
Database operations are available through both the C and Tcl
API's.
