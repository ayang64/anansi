[titledesc {Evaluate tcl in multiple interpreters}]

[description]

This command causes args to be sourced as a script in all Tcl interpreters for the current
virtual server.  Normally, the ns_eval is asynchronous and the script isn't immediately 
evaluated in the other interpreters until their next atalloc event.  If the -sync option
is specified, ns_eval blocks until all servers have executed the script.

[para]
The -pending flag, which cannot be specified with any other flags or args, returns a list of
the scritps still waiting to be evaluated in the various interpreters.

[para]
NOTE: This command is currently implemented in Tcl, in the source file nsd/init.tcl.

ns_eval is designed to work whether you pass your script as one argument or many arguments.
In order to accomplish this, the arguments are passed through:

[example_begin]
   uplevel 1 [lb]eval concat $args[rb]
[example_end]

which means that there are two rounds of concat behavior, unlike a straight eval.  See the example below of unsetting a global variable to see how this can play out.

[section EXAMPLES]

[example_begin]
   # Set a global variable accessible from all interpreters
   ns_eval set myGlobal 1
[example_end]

[example_begin]
   # Create a proc accessible from all interpreters, and wait
   # for it to be define in all of them before returning
   ns_eval -sync proc doSomething {args} { # do something }
[example_end]

[example_begin]
   # Get the list of pending scripts to be eval'd
   ns_eval -pending
[example_end]

[example_begin]
   # Unset an array variable in all interpreters.
   ns_eval {{if {[lb]info exists myGlobal[rb]} {unset myGlobal}}}
   # The code that ends up being evaluated in each interpeter is:
   # if {[lb]info exists myGlobal[rb]} {unset myGlobal}    
[example_end]
