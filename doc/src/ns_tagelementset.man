 ns_tagelementset tagvar attribute value


[list_end]

[description]

 This command takes a variable name to upvar, tagvar.  The variable should exist in the calling environment and should contain an HTML element that has had its closing ">" removed.  The string is searched for the attribute attribute, which will be removed if found.  A value attribute will be added to the end of the string with value value, which will be surrounded with double quotes.  This procedure does not close the tag with a ">".

[section EXAMPLES]

[example_begin]
   % set tag {&lt;input type="hidden" name="myfield" value="100"}
   &lt;input type="hidden" name="myfield" value="100"
[example_end]

[example_begin]
   % ns_tagelementset tag value 250
   &lt;input type="hidden" name="myfield"  value="250"
[example_end]

[para]NOTES

 I believe using "value" as the attribute name in the output instead of the passed in attribute may be a bug.
